# LSU Beamer Theme

Beamer Theme that I created for presentations using the color schemes of Louisiana State University.

## Changelog

 * v1.0: Initial version defines a color scheme using LSU's purple and gold colors for any beamer theme
 * v1.1: Created two themes that use the color scheme from v1.0
 * v1.2: Modify outer theme due to change in icon sizes

# LSU Powerdot Theme
Powerdot Theme using LSU colors created for the LaTeX presentation. (Why? because I had lot of time to 
evaluate powerdot)
